# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard (Tableau Project)

## Project Objective
This project focuses on building an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. It leverages a real-world EV dataset to extract insights about market trends, model popularity, state-wise distribution, and the impact of clean fuel incentives.The goal is to present actionable KPIs that support informed decision-making for government bodies, environmental researchers, and the automotive industry.
